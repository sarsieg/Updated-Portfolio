                My name is Sarah Siegel and I am a 24 year old living in Plymouth Minnesota with my two brothers Steven and Scott as well as Alicia and Jaime. We are accompanied by two wonderful dogs. My dog Pooh who is an American Bulldog at five years old and a little
                Sharpei named Shia who is one years old. I was born October 27, 1996 at 9:03am in Saint Louis Park Minnesota to my wonderful parents Stanley and Susan. We grew up in Wayzata Minnesota and were blessed with the best poodles in the world
                Sally, Sadie and Stacy. I am currently working on web development education at the University of Minnesota while working as a server at Maggie's Family Restaurant in downtown Wayzata Minnesota. Once I complete my web development education
                I am looking forward to using my skills and knowledge in web development to acquire a job in the field and go on to do great things with the information and expertise that I will have acquired through my education.
